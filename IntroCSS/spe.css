/* INHERITANCE:
If you specify a parent element to be a certain 
property then its children will inherit the property as well
ex) LI style will be inherited from UL style */

/*SPECIFICITY:
The more specific element style will win over any 
general overall style such as all (*) elements etc.
ex) class will trump tag style
ex) ID will trump class and tag style 
ID is the most specific, while type selector is the least specific*/
