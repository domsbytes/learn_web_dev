        <p> MMO Loren Ipsum ,that feeling will pass, but then I'll say in all honesty that I don't 
            know what other MMO I'd likely play any time soon, after GW2....what 
            is there, anyway? For instance, SWTOR has over 200,000 lines of spoken 
            dialogue, as verified by Guinness World Records. My plan moving forward 
            with the game is probably to play a <span>Norn Guardian</span>, a human Elementalist 
            and a Sylvari Warrior, and we’ll see which of those ends up as my main. 
            By that, I mean, they’ve decided to leave and we aren’t going to go follow 
            and beg them to reconsider.</p>

            <p>What I enjoyed the most and felt most confirmed in, is the overall feel of the game:
            the atmosphere, the large scale world, the music and art, and of course the classes 
            and races which I find, for the most part very accomplished and fun to play. EQ2 players 
            are a tolerably cheerful bunch as MMO players go (raiders excepted) and they do like a party.
            You could apply the same thing to the Mass effect 3 ending as well. Least time spent in group
            while leveling: SWTOR and STO - as far as I can recall,
            none of my capped characters in either game has ever joined a group for any reason.
